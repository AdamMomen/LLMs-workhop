[11/15/23, 10:45:43 AM] ~ Νικος: Hey all! My name is Nick, I’m 32 and coming to Bali in December - this time to stay for good. I would be happy to connect with some people who work in the field and share a similar journey. Right now I’m in between jobs - I have experience working with JavaScript, Typescript, React, HTML, SASS and CSS and I am still on a junior level, as my 180 degree career change wasn’t too long ago. I case you know anybody who could use my help, feel free to let me know. I am happy to finally follow my passion now and meet people who feel the same way. When I’m not coding or deepening my knowledge I enjoy gaming (all platforms), playing table tennis, photography or simply going to the beach to have a beer. Long story short - thanks for adding me to the group and looking forward to meet some of you soon. ✌🏽
[11/15/23, 10:46:00 AM] ~ Νικος: Sorry for the long text 😂
[11/15/23, 11:35:13 AM] ~ Faisal Ahmad: Welcome my friend
[11/15/23, 12:00:06 PM] ~ Gian 🙃: Welcome to Bali Nick!
What was your career before coding, if I may ask?

Some of us here are on the same path! 😁 
I'm switching from mechanical engineering and I love to hear similar stories of fellows, so motivational! 💪🏽 😄
[11/15/23, 12:02:03 PM] ~ Inigo: I switched from aerospace engineering to data/ml engineering 7 years ago, best decision ever! 💪
[11/15/23, 12:04:46 PM] ~ bot: i started from ai/ml and persuing the same. i was clueless and scared when i was in high school about which field to choose so i didnt have to switch careers but only technologies.
[11/15/23, 12:18:15 PM] ~ Νικος: Well I was working as a restaurant manager 😁 because of personal reasons in my childhood I was forced to earn money and grow up fast, so I never had the opportunity to study and work on my personal goals. The covid times made me realize that it's now or never and I did everything I could to make the switch. So cool to hear your stories 👌
[11/16/23, 9:33:51 AM] Adam Liu: Hi guys, I have a question and want some feedback.

[11/16/23, 9:34:22 AM] Adam Liu: Thanks
[11/16/23, 9:47:40 AM] ~ Lurie Kimmerle: Two thoughts

1) maybe nomad culture?  When place have a nomad community it tends to be easier to make friends.

2) what is the religious one measuring? My immediate thought was as a woman a culture where I need to dress more modestly, but ranking that good or bad feels odd. Did you mean religious tolerance?
[11/16/23, 10:17:44 AM] Adam Liu: It’s mainly for reviewing if a place is religious. So Indonesia would be yes (not good/bad) tho.

And the names will be changed a bit, like for quality of life would be changed to high/low etc
[11/16/23, 10:21:00 AM] ~ Lurie Kimmerle: I think the thumbs up thumbs down options makes that confusing because I see those as good vs bad instead of no vs yes.
[11/16/23, 11:44:40 AM] ~ Ellen: maybe having a check ✅ and this ror no‼️❌🚫❓will be more subtle

[11/18/23, 11:39:59 AM] ~ Wyndham: Probably Microsoft is at it again lol
[11/18/23, 11:41:50 AM] ~ /'I' 😁: Sounds fishy. I wonder what toes did he step on 🙃 independence of the board is great, but managing such a company with no equity makes one want to pocket some money. I don't know those folks thought, just wondering.
[11/18/23, 11:45:49 AM] ~ bot: " he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI."... sounds like it.

Also, knowing how aggressive is Microsoft there was for sure part of not entirely their pressure
[11/18/23, 11:58:52 AM] ~ Jeevan: May be Sam refused to pull the plug 😁 Microsoft might be unleashing something on us.

[11/18/23, 12:12:39 PM] ~ Wyndham: Apparently because OpenAi is technically a nonprofit then the board of director doesn't hold any equity.

I reached out to several people, but none felt like they had their hands around the topics/time. Does anyone want to lead this workshop? 

I'm happy to lend a hand in helping anyone prepare the knowledge/content. Otherwise, I'll lead it.

DM me if interested. Either way, I'll update people soon on the next events details 👍

[12/7/23, 12:45:18 PM] Sebastian Logan: We don't 😬
[12/7/23, 12:53:28 PM] ~ Gian 🙃: Next one will be again in two weeks right?
[12/7/23, 12:54:09 PM] ~ Gian 🙃: In that case I'll be back in Italy for about a month 🥲
[12/7/23, 12:55:00 PM] ~ Gian 🙃: If you guys think to do a streaming would be nice!
Since is a practical workshop might be interesting to follow along
[12/7/23, 1:10:26 PM] Sebastian Logan: Yeah, we'll shoot to have the next one in 2-weeks.

Regarding participating remotely; if a presenter wants to screen-share during their own workshop, they're more than welcome. However, properly filming and recording a speaker's audio (streaming or recorded) isn't a layer of overhead I personally want to commit to delivering.

That said, if there are any content creators that want to take on the responsibility pro bono...go for it!
[12/7/23, 1:12:45 PM] Sebastian Logan: ASLO: Thanks everyone for showing up today. Great turnout and discussion.

Adam is going to be leading the next workshop, where he will be getting everyone's hands dirty with hands on app development leveraging an LLM. 

Stay tuned for more details.
[12/7/23, 1:26:56 PM] ~ Gian 🙃: Yeah I understand the hassle, just a screen sharing if Adam is willing to do it and if also someone else is interested 😅

Btw thank you for today's sessions, great as always 💯

It's a full built LLM that you can run completely locally (offline). And it provides instructions for ingesting ones own documents.

Could be a great way to get more intimate with how these models work, as the whole thing is there for you to pick apart.

[12/17/23, 2:47:18 PM] ~ Inigo: Have u tried langchain?
[12/17/23, 2:54:12 PM] Sebastian Logan: Yeah I've played with the framework. Curious about peoples own implementations or if they're using products to solve this (or of course, no one cares about it!)
[12/17/23, 2:55:03 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: Hello. Tried to play a bit using the latest OpenAI API and Streamlit, uploaded a simple document containing the information about the company here:

[12/17/23, 2:56:23 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: Is this similiar to what you are referring?
[12/17/23, 2:57:08 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: not a production grade though just playing around 😁
[12/17/23, 2:58:04 PM] Sebastian Logan: Cool. So streamlit solved this for you?
[12/17/23, 2:59:18 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: Streamlit only provides the interface , basically it has some built in functions to render text field and everything to speed up the process but the backend I use in this case is Python, using OpenAI library
[12/17/23, 3:02:07 PM] Sebastian Logan: Cool. On the Python server, you're using LangChain to perform RAG operations to enrich the prompt?
[12/17/23, 3:04:59 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: The first version of the chatbot I tried to dev use this scenario, in which I vectorized documents uploaded then using Langchain as index retrieval.
[12/17/23, 3:05:23 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: But since OpenAI has provided built in function to do that in their latest updates, so the demo using Streamlit no longer using the previous method. In that demo, I uploaded the documents on the OpenAI Dashboard and use only basic Python and OpenAI lib to send the prompt.
[12/17/23, 3:05:48 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: I can say in terms of performance the first method is much faster though
[12/17/23, 3:07:34 PM] Sebastian Logan: When you chunked and embedded the docs, did you then do a straight one to one similarity based retrieval based on the embedded input message and the index? Or were you applying a more nuanced strategy?
[12/17/23, 3:13:12 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: Yes once embedded when I initialize the chat engine, I loaded the index from the storage then serve the index as the chat engine
[12/17/23, 3:14:24 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: So yea I just use a common method to load the index and use similarity based search, curious to know and try other strategy though
[12/17/23, 3:17:15 PM] Sebastian Logan: Did you start to hit/notice limitations on that?
[12/17/23, 3:19:11 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: the prototype haven’t gone through stress testing though, so far haven’t hit that limitation, but reading from the docs I guess there is some limitations
[12/17/23, 3:22:49 PM] Sebastian Logan: Good to know. Thanks for sharing 🙏
[12/17/23, 3:27:25 PM] ~ Calvin Susanto Putra: most welcome 🙏🏼
[12/17/23, 6:03:53 PM] Andi Chesoi: What’s the use case more precisely?
[12/17/23, 6:04:54 PM] Andi Chesoi: What note-taking app do you use?
[12/17/23, 6:05:08 PM] Andi Chesoi: I use Notion AI, for my previous PKM
[12/17/23, 6:05:57 PM] Andi Chesoi: And Elephas with LogSeq/Obsidian for my current/local brain
[12/17/23, 9:20:05 PM] Sebastian Logan: I'm trying to understand others' use cases better. For example, do people ever find the need to augment LLMs with their own knowledge, or just rely on the embedded knowledge in weights? If people are augmenting, how/why are they doing it? For example, are they just putting thousands of words in a prompt context,  or chunking + indexing their  docs? For those chucking and indexing, is it a straight semantic retrieval or a more sophisticated algorithm.
[12/17/23, 11:11:35 PM] ~ Ellen: I have built some LLM based app with a custom knowledge base, but mostly for company internal document search and document organization purpose; lawfirm, customer service, ticket support management, etc.

Concept is pretty simple;
Text > chunking > Embedding > Store in Database> Calculate similiarity on the embedded vector > semantic search > predict/completion

Back then(last year) i had to use my own classes on python to manage this chunking, embedding, semantic search process. But nowadays, there is a library like langchain that allows you to manage this process smoothly and allow u to integrate with various LLM model.

I wrote a 30 mins guide on this blog on simple implementation of this >  https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/create-your-own-chatbot-for-pdf-documents-with-openai-gpt-and-streamlit-e5b35826bc1e
[12/17/23, 11:12:41 PM] ~ Ellen: Regarding note taking, it's a cool idea, i like notion AI, but it seems to me its just auto completing based on general knowledge. I haven't really use my own knowledge base for note taking as i don't really need it on my field, i am happy with code completion, thats enough Haha 
It is a cool idea tho to be able to have a personal note assistant tailored to your own personality 😂💪, I mentored group of students in a coding bootcamp implementing this idea last year - and yea it is possible, you can take a look at their demo video on how they implement that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj53xMaeQbc ‎<This message was edited>
[12/17/23, 11:14:13 PM] ~ Ellen: this was before the hype of langchain llamaindex and flowise, so technological side, it might not be up to date. as they deal with the database creation, back end - front end dev on their own without fancy library
[12/18/23, 10:12:09 AM] Sebastian Logan: They did a great job. Thanks for sharing.
[12/18/23, 10:14:17 AM] Sebastian Logan: This is a nice flow. We're they only concerned with knowledge storage? Or did you guys venture into the retrieval part, where they're own structured notes and knowledge were being pulled back onto an LLM for generating responses?
[12/18/23, 11:52:46 AM] ~ Ellen: it was not showing in the video, but they did store the embedding of knowledge in the database. Tho, u are correct, mostly its just the info retrieval process, the main goal for this early version of this project was building a graph/neuron-like data mapping to be able to identify what to suggest in the future. just like the brain.

The OpenAI here is only utilized to get general info of certain keywords; definition & summary

But the main knowledge source for the notes are still the summarized version from the notes it self which then can be used for auto completion model.
The auto completion with its own knowledge source wasnt part of the project scope.

[12/19/23, 9:57:48 AM] ~ Rob: Hello devs/coders!

I'm looking for a developer for a pretty big website project for a company that sells European bamboo to farmers + Carbon Credits to private businesses and entrepreneurs. Here's some keypoints I know already:

1️⃣ The project will start in January/february next year
2️⃣ The website will need a registration and login function, where farmers can see certain stats of their crops/carbon credits/impact on nature. So there will be API and database stuff going on in the back-end
3️⃣ There might be some interactive stuff going on on the homepage, like an interactive map where ppl can zoom in on our bamboo fields across Europe etc and see/experience their progression. An immersive experience where visitors would see the potential/value of European Bamboo (combined with storytelling)

➡️ I am the designer of this website, so you'll work with me.
➡️ I do not know yet how much work it will be, because we still need to setup a sitemap/functionalities etc. We have an internal meeting for this soon.
➡️ I work with Framer mostly, but I don't know if this is the best platform for building a website with login/registration and API stuff going on (we can discuss this as professionals and see what's the best platform to use).

Reply privately if you think you're suitable for this kind of job. Portfolio with similar work (login/reg/account/API stuff/interactive visuals) would be nice to show 😁

[12/21/23, 8:16:54 PM] Adam Momen: Hey folks, it took a while but the LLM workshop is finally planned.

In the workshop we are gonna build a chatbot agent that makes API requests on weather forecast server. (Bonus: implementation of RAG if we had enough time)

[12/22/23, 2:10:37 PM] Sebastian Logan: https://youtu.be/iqXjGiQ_D-A?si=gsdzElxhq6aC5RRQ. David has some really interesting ideas in the 1st third of this regarding how rising interest rates will impact the development community, and how low interest rates influenced the fragmented JS ecosystem during the 2010's. Worth watching, and if you're a Rails dev the rest is exciting stuff.
[12/22/23, 4:35:16 PM] Adam Momen: Thanks Sebastian, I’ve enjoyed watching him on the Ruby on Rails documentary by honeypot on YouTube, will watch it, thanks for sharing ‎<This message was edited>
